# Agent brief — hourly self-improvement

You are improving **easypanel-cli**: a Rust CLI + full-screen ratatui TUI for managing
multiple [EasyPanel](https://easypanel.io) hosts. Read `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
before anything else.

**Goal:** make this project scalable, credible, and genuinely useful to the GitHub
community. One meaningful improvement per run — quality over volume.

---

## Hard constraint: you have no live server

You have **no EasyPanel server, no credentials, and no way to obtain them.** Never
invent any.

This matters far more than it sounds. Almost every real bug in this project was found
by calling a live server, and **none** of them by unit tests:

| Bug | Why tests missed it |
|---|---|
| `updateSourceGithub` silently reset `autoDeploy` to `false` | Endpoint side effect, invisible to any mock |
| Load column always read `0.00` | `loadAvg` is a flat array of 3 strings, not a `[ts, value]` series |
| **Every** server error message was discarded | EasyPanel nests `message` under `json`; the code read the top level — and **the test passed**, because its mock used a shape the server never sends |

That last one is the lesson: **a test that encodes a wrong assumption is worse than no
test**, because it converts a bug into evidence of correctness.

Therefore:

- Do not change behaviour that only a live API can validate.
- Never write a mock asserting an API response shape you cannot verify.
- Never write "verified", "tested against the server", or "confirmed working" for
  something you did not actually run.
- If an improvement needs live verification, **open a GitHub issue describing it and
  stop.** Do not guess.

## The backlog — start here

**Work the top unfinished item.** Check whether it is already done before starting; if
it is, move to the next. These are all verifiable with `cargo` alone — no live server,
no excuses. You are expected to finish one per run.

1. ~~**Shell completions.**~~ Done — `completions <shell>` covers bash/zsh/fish/elvish/
   powershell, documented in the README, one test per shell.
2. ~~**Man page.**~~ Done — `man` renders `easypanel.1`; the release tarball ships it and
   `install.sh` installs it.
3. ~~**`cargo audit`.**~~ Done — CI runs it on every push and weekly on a schedule
   (advisories appear whether or not you commit). Reports 0 vulnerabilities today.
4. ~~**Upgrade ratatui 0.29 → 0.30.**~~ Done. Cleared the `lru` unsoundness and
   dropped `paste`; `cargo audit` went from 3 warnings to 1, and that one
   (`async-std`) is dev-only via `httpmock` and never ships. Required **no code
   changes** — the APIs this project uses were untouched by the major bump.
5. ~~**Configure a service while creating it, not after.**~~ Done in v0.10.0. `n` sends
   the source inline with `createService`. Field visibility now takes several conditions
   (service type AND source type), `Form::switch` is gone, and the source labels were
   renamed (`Source`, `Docker image`, `Registry user`, `Registry password`) so the merged
   form has no duplicate label for `by_label()`'s `find()` to resolve wrongly. Build/env/
   domains/ports/resources are still `createService`-capable and still not offered —
   propose them separately, one at a time.

6. ~~**Split `src/tui.rs`.**~~ Done in v0.11.1. 5,087 lines became `tui/` — `worker`
   (network, Req/Resp only), `app` (state + selectors), `keys` (a second `impl App`:
   key -> action), `form`, `table`, `render` (draws, decides nothing), `mod` (event loop,
   `$EDITOR` hand-off, the only holder of `ServerConfig`). No behaviour change: the same
   83 tests, untouched, and the test-name list diffed identical before and after. Largest
   file is now `app.rs` at ~960 lines. Tests deliberately stayed in one `tui/tests.rs` —
   an untouched suite is the proof; distributing them is separate work.
7. **Dockerfile source type.** The panel offers five sources; this offers three.
   `services/app/updateSourceDockerfile` takes the Dockerfile inline, so it needs the
   `$EDITOR` hand-off `edit_env_in_editor` already implements — a Dockerfile does not
   belong in a single-line field. (`uploadCodeArchive` is the fifth; it takes a
   server-side `archivePath`, so it needs a file transfer this tool has no path for.
   Investigate before promising it.)
8. **`unwrap`/`expect` audit.** Find every one reachable from untrusted input (API
   responses, config files, `$EDITOR`, terminal size). Each either becomes a real error
   or gets a comment proving it cannot fire.
9. **`--json` output** for the read-only commands (`stats`, `monitor services`,
   `project list`, `domain list`, …) so people can script against it. Print the API's
   own JSON; do not invent a schema.
10. **Test coverage for `src/config.rs` and `src/output.rs` edge cases** — malformed
   JSON, missing file, unreadable permissions, empty series, huge byte values.
11. **Issue and PR templates** under `.github/`, plus README badges (CI, release,
   licence).
12. **`cargo publish` readiness** — `cargo package --list` clean, no stray files.

When the list is empty, propose the next item at the bottom of this file in your PR
rather than inventing work silently.

## Also in scope, any time

- **Docs accuracy.** A README that promises what the code does not do is a bug — it once
  claimed `stats` showed uptime, which nothing rendered.
- **Dependency updates**, CI improvements, packaging.
- **Contrast/accessibility** — named colours (`Color::Blue`) are reinterpreted by
  terminal themes and have twice produced unreadable text here. Use `Color::Indexed`.

## You are expected to ship

The constraints below are about **how** to work, not permission to skip working. "Do
nothing" is only correct when the whole backlog above is genuinely done — which today it
is not. Fourteen consecutive runs that produced nothing is a failure, not caution.

If you cannot push or open a PR, **say so loudly and specifically in your final
message** (the exact command and the exact error). Do not fail silently.

## Out of scope

Anything requiring a live EasyPanel host: new endpoints, changed request bodies,
response-shape assumptions, metrics joins. File an issue instead.

## Bug classes that keep recurring here — hunt these

1. **Filtered view vs. action index.** If a table filters what it renders but an action
   (`x`, `e`) indexes the *unfiltered* list, it hits the wrong row. Render and actions
   must share one filtered source.
2. **Silent defaults that change config.** A dropdown whose current value is missing
   from its option list must not jump to the first option — that silently changes what
   deploys. Preserve the current value.
3. **Unmodelled fields dropped on edit.** Edit forms must start from the original JSON
   so fields the form does not model (middlewares, `nixpacksVersion`) survive.
4. **Confidently wrong numbers.** A metric that reads `0.00` because of a shape
   mismatch is worse than a missing one. Prefer `-` over a fake `0`.
5. **Destructive actions without confirmation.** Deleting a server used to wipe its
   token instantly, with no prompt and no way to recover it.

## Drive the TUI and look at it before you call anything done

Required by the project owner, and the record backs them up. Every one of these was
found by a **human looking at the screen**, never by a test:

| What the tests said | What the screen showed |
|---|---|
| 76 green | `Enter` on a dropdown could never save the form — "Service baru" for type `app` had **no way to submit at all** |
| A test named `empty_project_shows_no_metrics_not_negative_zero` passed | `-0.0 %` had been on screen for two releases |
| `destroy` returned OK | The deleted row stayed in the table until a manual refresh |

Unit tests here check *shapes*. They cannot see a form you cannot escape, a key that
does nothing, a column that never updates, or a 100-second wait with no feedback. So:

- **Run the binary.** Open the screen you changed, press the keys a user would press,
  and complete the whole workflow end to end — not just the one key you touched.
- **Ask about the round trip**, not the request: after a create/delete/toggle, does the
  table *show* it? Does the status line say something true?
- **Time it.** If an action takes more than a couple of seconds, the UI must say so
  before it starts. `createService` with a github source takes ~100 s; silence there is
  indistinguishable from a freeze.
- **Every field must be reachable and leavable.** Tab through the form; if focus can
  land somewhere the form cannot be submitted or cancelled from, that is a bug.
- Prefer a unit test on the row/body builder for the *assertion*, but only after you
  have watched the real thing work. A green suite is not evidence that the feature is
  usable.

## Do not trust your own harness

Measurement lied more often than the code did in this project's history:

- zsh's builtin `echo` interprets backslash escapes and **corrupts JSON** (`\n` inside a
  string becomes a real newline). This caused a false "the server returns malformed
  JSON" claim that reached a commit message.
- `tac` does not exist on macOS; a verification loop silently ran zero times and its
  empty output read as "passed".
- ratatui **diff-renders**: only changed cells are emitted. Screen-scraping a TUI for a
  count is unreliable — a stale title reads as a broken feature. Prefer unit tests over
  scraping.

When a check says something is broken, first ask whether the *check* is broken.

## Every change ships a release

Non-negotiable, per the project owner:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` using
   [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) headings
   (Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed / Security).
2. When the change is complete and green, promote `[Unreleased]` to the new version,
   bump `version` in `Cargo.toml` (semver), and tag `vX.Y.Z`.
3. Pushing the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds binaries for
   linux-x86_64, darwin-arm64, and darwin-x86_64 and publishes the GitHub Release.
4. Release notes explain **what changed and why it mattered** — not a diff summary. If a
   bug could have destroyed data or shown a wrong number, say so plainly.

Trivial or no-op runs need no release. Do not invent work to justify one.

## Definition of done

- `cargo fmt --check` clean
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean
- `cargo test` green
- CHANGELOG updated; release tagged if user-visible
- Commit message states what changed and **why**, and honestly names what was *not*
  verified
